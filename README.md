# Linux-Tools
A collection of tools I've written to improve upon, and create new unix shell commands. Executables have been pushed along with source code.

To add the executable as a shell command:
*sudo cp \<executableName\> /bin/*  
  
**dirmem**: Lists disk usage in bytes of path entered as argument.  
**Usage**: *dirmem \<path\>"*
